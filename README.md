## About Me 🚀

🎓 I am Tapajyoti Bose aka **ruppysuppy** a cross-platform developer pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science & Engineering.

👨‍💻 I enjoy contributing to Open Source Projects and am really enthusiastic about learning new technology. In 2020, I learnt Django, Electron, Flutter, React and TypeScript.

🎸 Outside the world of tech too, I love pushing myself to develop new skills ranging from guitar, dancing (hip-hop), sketching, cooking, touch typing to some whacky ones like writing with my left hand (only aiming from mastery in guitar and dancing though).

🔥 I am a strong believer in the concept of FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) and aiming to retire by 35 using the formula **`money earned ∝ value generated`**. A small note: Retirement for me means I would not have to work to earn money anymore, but would be free to work on the things I am passionate about.

📚 I love reading personal development & financial literacy books. My favourites ones being: **The Compound Effect**
by _Darren Hardy_ in the genre of personal development and **Rich Dad Poor Dad** by _Robert Kiyosaki_ in the genre of financial literacy.

✈️ I love travelling as well, even though its been some time since I last travelled. My last trip was a solo trip to **Bhutan** in _2018_.
